# Food Delivery Microservices on Kubernetes

## ðŸš§ Project Status

The project is currently being upgraded. Some parts may not work as described here. Please check back for updates.

---

This repository demonstrates a fully functional microservices-based food delivery application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes. The project comprises several independent microservices along with a frontend aggregator for unified access, providing a realistic example of a productionâ€“grade microservices architecture.

## Overview

This project implements a food delivery application using microservices architecture. Each service runs as an independent Docker container and is deployed on Kubernetes. The applicationâ€™s primary components include the user, restaurant, order, and delivery microservices, with their respective MongoDB databases deployed inside the cluster. A frontend aggregator is provided (using EJS) to integrate the overall system into a single interface.

---

## Architecture

- **Microservices**:
  - **User Service** â€“ Handles user registration, login, and user management.
  - **Restaurant Service** â€“ Manages restaurant details, menus, and related operations.
  - **Order Service** â€“ Responsible for order placement, tracking, and management.
  - **Delivery Service** â€“ Oversees delivery assignment and tracking.
- **Databases**: Each service has its dedicated MongoDB instance running as a separate pod and exposed via a ClusterIP Service (e.g., user-db, restaurant-db, order-db, and delivery-db).
- **Frontend Aggregator**: A simple EJS-based aggregator provides a unified dashboard to interact with the microservices.
- **Deployment & Orchestration**: Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub (using the Docker Hub username, for example, `nsvpavan`) and Kubernetes YAML manifests from the `k8s` directory deploy and manage the microservices.

---

## Services

- **user-service**: Exposes RESTful APIs for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **restaurant-service**: Provides APIs for managing restaurant data, menus, and details.
- **order-service**: Handles order creation, updates, and status tracking; also communicates with user and restaurant services.
- **delivery-service**: Manages delivery assignments, tracking, and updates.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed on your machine.
- **Kubernetes cluster** (e.g., Minikube or any other local/remote cluster).
- **kubectl** configured to communicate with your cluster.
- Docker Hub account with images pushed using the username (e.g., `nsvpavan`).

---

## Setup & Deployment

### Local Deployment with Docker Compose

For running the entire stack locally using Docker Compose, use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. This is useful for development and quick testing.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Start your Kubernetes Cluster**  
   For example, using Minikube:

   ```bash
   minikube start --driver=docker
   ```

2. **Set Up the Namespace**  
   Apply the namespace manifest:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
   ```

3. **Deploy Microservice Databases**  
   Apply the YAML files for each database:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/user-db-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/user-db-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/restaurant-db-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/restaurant-db-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/order-db-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/order-db-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/delivery-db-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/delivery-db-service.yaml
   ```

4. **Deploy Microservices**  
   Then, deploy each microservice:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/user-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/user-service-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/restaurant-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/restaurant-service-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/order-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/order-service-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/delivery-service-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/delivery-service-service.yaml
   ```

5. **Verify Deployments**  
   Check that all pods are running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n fooddelivery
   kubectl get deployments -n fooddelivery
   ```

6. **Test Endpoints**  
   Use port-forwarding for local testing:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/user-service 3001:3001 -n fooddelivery
   ```

   Then test via curl:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```

---

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables**:  
  Each microservice expects a `MONGODB_URI` variable pointing to its respective in-cluster database service (e.g., `mongodb://user-db:27017/users` for the user service).

  Frontend directory until this commit expects VITE_RESTAURANT_URL, VITE_CART_URL, VITE_AUTH_URL.

  Cart service expects: MONGO_URI,PORT,JWT_SECRET(same as user service)

  Restaurant service expects: MONGO_URI,PORT

  User service expects: MONGO_URI,PORT,JWT_SECRET

- **Init Containers**:  
  Optionally, init containers in the deployments wait for the databases to become available before starting the application containers.

- **Image Tagging**:  
  Docker images are tagged and pushed to Docker Hub (e.g., `nsvpavan/backend-user-service:latest`). Make sure your deployment YAMLs reference these images.

---

## Testing & Verification

- **Verify Pod Status**:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n fooddelivery
  ```

- **Check Logs for Issues**:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -n fooddelivery
  ```

- **Service Connectivity**:  
  Use a temporary pod (via busybox) to test service DNS resolution:

  ```bash
  kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never busybox --image=busybox -n fooddelivery -- sh
  ```

  Inside the pod:

  ```bash
  wget -qO- http://user-db:27017
  ```

- **API Testing**:  
  Use curl or Postman to test the exposed endpoints as necessary.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Timeouts**:  
  Ensure that the environment variables in the deployments point to the correct service names (e.g., `user-db` and not `user_db`).

- **Deployment Updates**:  
  If changes are not reflected, use `kubectl edit` or `kubectl patch` commands to ensure the correct environment variables are in place.

- **Pod Logs**:  
  Check logs for errors or connection issues:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name> -n fooddelivery
  ```
